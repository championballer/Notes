	* Understanding
	* Remembering
	* Focusing
* Memorizing vs Understanding?
* What is the forgetting curve?

## Understanding anything with the Feynman Technique

* What is the Feynman Technique?
* General tips to apply Feynman Technique
	* Keep the language simple
	* Drill down the essence of some paragraph or answer to a question in your own words

##  Science of Active Recall
* Reason that the majority of people are not getting marks?
* Utility of practice testing?
* Active recall is the activity of testing ourselves in recalling the content we have understood at regular intervals. Better than feeding our brain is the practice of fetching from our brain, since that is the activity we actually use, so practicing fetching is a better way to go about learning.

## Learning new content with active recall
* While going through some content, we should periodically stop and quiz ourselves as to what we have read, and try to explain the essence of the material in our own words. If we feel that the explanation isnâ€™t satisfactory or there are gaps, we should go back and get a better look at things. 
* Story of a person who practiced the technique from Make it Stick book : Med student without prerequisites. Only mechanism was to read books for information. Worked with active recall, and made sure to check if his understanding or the essence he wrote down actually matched up with the real thing. Major issue he faced was in sticking to the technique and trusting the process. 
* Main gist of the video is that we should incorporate the process of active learning throughout the learning process and not only during the revision or memorising phase. 

## Taking notes in class
* Handwritten notes > Typed notes
* Cornell system of note taking. Bifurcation into two sides. One side has the notes, and the other side has questions related to the section. Works well with active recall as well. 

## Taking notes after class
* To consolidate knowledge and increase the understanding of the lecture topics. 
* Can become cumbersome, and should be done in subjects where it is necessary. In other words, convenience should also be kept in mind. 
* Active recall should be kept in mind. In my opinion, this should be done keeping in mind the source and ease of access. Toggle method for question answer based technique can also be used. Or a list of questions only can also be made. 

## Scoping the Subject
* Taking some time to understand the structure of the subject (make lists of headings and subheadings in the subject), so that we have an overall understanding on where a smaller topic fits in the bigger picture. 
* This also allows us to better strategise and categorise topics. This leads to us understanding the smaller topics with reference to other topics in the subject.
